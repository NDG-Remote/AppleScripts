AppleScripts for Automator

[YYYY-MM-DD Shortcut](/yyyy-mm-dd-shortcut)
The script I provid here is for creating a **keyboard shortcut** to insert the current date in the **YYYY-MM-DD** format. This can be helpful for naming files or folders with a consistent and sortable date format. Here's a breakdown of the steps you've outlined:

1. In Automator, create a new "Quick Action"
1. Add a single "Run Applescript" action
1. Insert the code
1. Save it and I name it (e.g. "type the date", but you can call it whatever you like)
1. In System Preferences->Keyboard->Keyboard Shortcuts->Services, locate the "type the date" service, click the checkbox to "on", and add a shortcut. I used "command-control-option-D" (again you can use anything you like).
